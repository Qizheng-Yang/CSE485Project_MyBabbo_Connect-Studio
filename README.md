Project Description: The goal of this project is to design and develop a user-friendly web

pre-designed templates to create meaningful and visually appealing video tributes. The
application will offer an intuitive interface for seamless video creation, providing
customization options while ensuring simplicity, so users can honor loved ones in a
thoughtful, heartfelt way. The app will also include features for video preview, editing, and
